# LINKDIN_AUTOMATED_JOB_APPLY

STEP:1

Sign up to LinkedIn and Configure your Profile
We'll be using LinkedIn to apply for jobs automatically, so you'll need to set up your profile and account on the website before we get started.

1. Make sure you've signed up to LinkedIn and save your email and password somewhere for later use.

NOTE: Do not enable 2-factor authentication/phone number verification while we are using Selenium.

2. Companies who look at your application will look through your LinkedIn profile to see if you have the skills and necessary work experience. If you are serious about applying for jobs make sure you update your LinkedIn Profile.

3. Upload your resume by going to Me -> Settings & Privacy -> Job Seeking Preferences -> Job Application Settings


STEP:2

1. Go to the Jobs tab and search for the job that you are interested in e.g. "Python developer". Add the "Easy Apply" filter and specify your desired location.
2. 2. Copy the URL at the top of the address bar, it should contain all your requirements. e.g.

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?f_LF=f_AL&geoId=102257491&keywords=python%20developer&location=London%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom&redirect=false&position=1&pageNum=0
